# This is a properties file for sample.oauth.store project. These properties are used to
# configure the connection to MongoDB for both the OAuthStore implementations and the tests.
#
# The file is copied to the server directory of Liberty during start-up for the 
# bell.sample.
#
# Uncomment the USER and PWD lines to use authentication when connecting to MongoDB.
#
# Modify the START_MONGODB property to false if you have a MongDB instance running that
# you wish to connect to for running tests. Otherwise; the test framework will start
# a non-persistent MongoDB instance to complete the tests. If a MongoDB instance is not to
# be started ensure that the MongoDB instance is running prior to running the tests and
# that HOST and PORT point to the running instance.

DBNAME=oauthSample
